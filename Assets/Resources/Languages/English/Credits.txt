<color=#ffb400>VERY SPECIAL THANKS</color>
To all my family and friends: Thank you so much for your love and support during the development of Carpark. Your patience and understanding make it all possible. I love you!

To my players: Thank you for your passion and enthusiasm. You continue to push us forward and inspire me. I couldn’t do it without you!

Also, a mention for people I have met throughout the Carpark development. You have crossed my life someone to stay it, others just passing. Instead of you're now a part of my life. A big hug!
